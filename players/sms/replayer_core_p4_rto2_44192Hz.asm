; Modified in 2016 by Maxim for operation on Sega 8-bit consoles (and similar 
; hardware with IO-mapped SN76489 variants)

;
; Replayer core to play packed-volume 44192kHz samples generated by pcmenc
;
; pcmenc should use the following command line arguments:
;
; pcmenc -rto 2 -p 4 -dt1 76 -dt2 11 -dt3 75 file.wav
;
; and optionally -r to split sample into blocks for rom replayer
;

; There are three channel updates per two underlying samples.
; One channel update is for the odd samples, the other two are
; for the even ones. We try to make these second two as close together 
; as possible, and equalise the spacing to the first. 
; The total loop length is 162 cycles, to match an underlying sample 
; at 44100Hz (3579545 / 162 * 2 = 44192).
